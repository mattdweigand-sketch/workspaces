# Constraint 06: I Do Not Know What Layer This Problem Belongs On

## The Problem

You are using AI for everything. Email drafts, data lookups, scheduling, calculations, formatting, brainstorming, writing, analysis. Some of these tasks come back great. Others come back wrong, slow, or more expensive than doing them by hand. You cannot figure out why the same tool works brilliantly on some tasks and poorly on others.

The reason is that not every task is an AI task. Language models are probabilistic reasoning engines. They are excellent at tasks that require judgment, synthesis, creativity, and pattern matching across unstructured information. They are mediocre at tasks that require deterministic accuracy (exact calculations, data lookups, formatting to a precise spec). And they are wasteful on tasks that a simple rule, formula, or existing tool handles perfectly.

The question is not "can AI do this?" It almost always can. The question is "should AI do this, or is there a layer beneath AI that handles it better, faster, and cheaper?"

## Layer 1: Principles That Predate AI

Every new technology goes through a phase where people try to use it for everything. When spreadsheets first appeared, people tried to use them as databases, word processors, and project management tools. When databases arrived, people tried to put everything in a database. When the web arrived, every application became a web app regardless of whether it should have been.

The pattern resolves the same way every time. People learn which problems the new technology actually solves better than what came before, and they stop using it for everything else. That learning phase is where most AI users are right now.

The framework for this has existed in various forms since the early days of computing. The layer model. Your operating system has layers: hardware, kernel, system services, applications. Each layer handles the problems it is best suited for. You do not ask the application layer to manage memory allocation. You do not ask the kernel to render a user interface.

Herbert Simon described bounded rationality in 1955: decision-makers operate within the limits of the information and cognitive resources available to them. Applying this to tool selection: use the simplest tool that solves the problem. Complexity costs you in time, tokens, unpredictability, and maintenance. A database query does not hallucinate.

**Traditional tools by layer:**
- **Deterministic tasks (exact answers, calculations, formatting):** your system of record's calculation engine, database queries, purpose-built software, deterministic scripts, find-and-replace. (A spreadsheet computes the same math, but it has no access controls, permissions, or audit trail: fine for a throwaway check, wrong for anything that matters.)
- **Rule-based tasks (if/then logic, routing, categorization with known categories):** Zapier, Make, n8n, email filters, form builders, basic database queries.
- **Judgment tasks (synthesis, fuzzy categorization, creative work, analysis of unstructured text):** This is where AI adds genuine value.

## Layer 2: Existing Skills and Tools

The tools that handle the non-AI layers are not exotic. You probably already use some of them.

**Deterministic software and databases**
For anything with one right answer (billing math, reconciliations, categorization by known rules), use a tool that computes it deterministically: your platform's calculation engine, a database query, or purpose-built software. These never hallucinate, run instantly, and cost nothing per run. A spreadsheet can do the same math, but for any team it is the wrong home for anything that matters: no access controls, no permissions, no audit trail, and one fat-fingered cell propagates silently. Keep deterministic work in systems with the controls and trail an auditor expects.

**Zapier / Make / n8n (workflow automation)**
If your task is "when X happens, do Y," this is a rule-based automation. Email arrives with attachment, save attachment to specific folder. Form submitted, write the record to your database and send a confirmation email. These are deterministic chains. They do not need judgment. Running them through an AI model adds latency, cost, and the possibility of error where there was none.

**n8n specifically** (n8n.io, self-hosted option available) connects to hundreds of services and lets you build multi-step workflows with branching logic. It also has an MCP server, which means an AI agent can trigger n8n workflows when the task involves deterministic steps that the model should not handle itself.

**Database queries (SQL, Airtable, Notion databases)**
If you are asking AI to find or aggregate structured data, a database query is faster and exact. "How many tickets did we close in Q1?" is a SQL query or a report from your system of record, not an AI prompt. "What do our slowest-to-resolve tickets have in common, and what does it suggest about our support process?" is an AI task. Know the difference.

**Purpose-built software**
Before you build an AI workflow, check if purpose-built software already handles it. For most teams, this is most of the stack: your CRM, your accounting or ERP platform, your ticketing system, your HRIS, your data warehouse. Outside the core systems: project management (Asana, Linear), document formatting (Word's style system), calendar management. These tools have spent years optimizing for their specific domain. They will outperform a general-purpose model on their core tasks, and the systems of record carry the governance and audit trail a model cannot (see Constraint 09).

## Layer 3: The Architectural Fix

The 60/30/10 framework provides the triage heuristic:

**60% of what you are building should be traditional code, databases, or established tools.** This is the stable foundation. Databases, file systems, deterministic scripts, purpose-built software, your platform's calculation engine. These layers are reliable, fast, auditable, and cheap to run. They do not drift, hallucinate, or require token budgets.

**30% should be rule-based logic.** If/then routing, automation workflows, templates with conditional sections, decision trees. This layer handles the "which path do we take" decisions that have clear criteria. Zapier, Make, n8n, email rules, form logic. These are more flexible than pure deterministic tools but still predictable.

**10% should be AI.** The tasks that genuinely require judgment, synthesis, or creativity. Writing, analysis of unstructured data, creative brainstorming, translating between domains, fuzzy categorization, generating first drafts. This is where language models earn their cost.

**The layer beneath the three: your data foundation.**

For any organization, the bottom of this stack is not a spreadsheet. It is your system of record: the platform that owns normalized, reconciled, current data, the figures of record, access controls that reflect who is entitled to see what, and an audit trail you can hand an auditor. That foundation is not something you build with AI, and it is not something you build with a folder structure. It is an enterprise platform decision (your CRM, ERP, accounting system, or data warehouse and the software underneath it).

This matters because AI does not fail at the model. It fails at the data. A capable model on top of data that is fragmented across systems, weeks or months stale, and reconciled by hand in Excel will give you a confident answer drawn from a lagged copy of your business. The model is not working on your real state. Getting the foundation right is the prerequisite, not the afterthought. Constraint 09 covers how to evaluate that foundation.

The rule: rely on your platform for the numbers and the record. Use AI for the language and the judgment on top of it. The fastest way to a wrong figure in a customer's inbox is letting AI compute what your platform should be the source of truth for.

**The diagnostic:**

For every task in your workflow, ask these questions in order:

0. **Is this a system-of-record question?** Does a correct answer depend on authoritative, reconciled, current data, or on writing to a system you cannot afford to get wrong (the books, account balances, issue status, who owns a record)? If yes, this belongs on your enterprise platform. AI can read from that foundation; it should not be that foundation, and you should not rebuild it yourself. Stop here.

1. **Is the answer deterministic?** Is there one right answer that can be calculated or looked up? If yes, use your platform, a database, or purpose-built software. Stop here.

2. **Can it be expressed as an if/then rule?** If category is X, do Y. If amount exceeds threshold, flag for review. If yes, use an automation tool or a simple script. Stop here.

3. **Does it require judgment across unstructured information?** Synthesis, interpretation, creativity, pattern matching across text that does not fit neatly into rows and columns? If yes, this is an AI task.

Most people reverse this order. They start with "can AI do this?" and the answer is almost always yes, so they use AI. Then they wonder why their workflow is slow, expensive, and inconsistent. Running the diagnostic in the correct order, starting from the simplest layer, routes each task to the tool that handles it best.

**The Coca-Cola principle:**

Coca-Cola exists because refrigeration exists. Coca-Cola is not a refrigeration company. They used the technology to do something else at a scale that was never possible before. The companies that won from refrigeration were not the ones that built better refrigerators. They were the ones that figured out what refrigeration made possible.

Apply this to AI. The value is not in having AI. The value is in what AI makes possible for your team, your customers, and your work. If you are spending your time optimizing the AI itself (building agents, fine-tuning prompts for tasks that should be database queries or reports from your system of record, creating elaborate automations for simple problems), you are building refrigerators when you should be selling Coke.

**How this changes your workspace design:**

When you design a workspace for a repeatable workflow, each stage should declare which layer handles it. Some stages are fully automated with traditional tools (data import, formatting, file management). Some stages use rule-based routing (categorization, triage, template selection). Some stages use AI (writing, analysis, synthesis).

A well-designed workspace has most of its stages on the bottom two layers. AI stages are concentrated where judgment genuinely matters. This makes the workflow cheaper, faster, and more reliable. It also makes the AI stages work better because the model is not wasting context on tasks that a formula should handle.

## Tuning Questions

**1. Walk through your last five tasks. For each one, which layer should have handled it?**
Be honest. If three of the five were lookups, calculations, or formatting tasks, you are over-indexing on AI. Move those to the appropriate layer. Your AI tasks will run faster and better once they are not competing with deterministic work for your attention and token budget.

**2. What are you currently doing with AI that produces exact, consistent results every time?**
If the answer is "nothing," that is expected. AI is probabilistic. But if you have tasks that need exact, consistent results, those tasks should not be on AI. Move them to a deterministic layer where exactness is guaranteed.

**3. What would break if AI were unavailable for a day?**
The tasks that would break are your genuine AI dependencies. Everything else is convenience, not necessity. That does not mean you should stop using AI for convenience tasks. But you should know the difference. Your critical workflow should degrade gracefully if the model is slow, down, or producing lower quality output on a given day. Tasks on deterministic layers do not have that problem.

**4. Where does the data your AI reads actually come from, and how fresh is it?**
If your AI is drafting a customer update off numbers you pasted from a 90-day-old export reconciled by hand, the update will be fluent and wrong. Trace every figure your AI touches back to its source. If the source is not authoritative and current, the problem is your data foundation, not your prompt. Fix the foundation first (Constraint 09).

## Quick Reference

| If this is your situation | Start here |
|---|---|
| AI gives inconsistent results on a task that should have one right answer | This is a deterministic task. Move it to your platform, a database query, or purpose-built software. |
| You built an AI workflow that just routes things based on simple criteria | This is a rule-based task. Move it to Zapier, Make, or n8n. |
| You are using AI to reconcile data across systems or compute figures of record | This is a data-foundation job. It belongs on your enterprise platform, not in a prompt or a DIY build. See Constraint 09. |
| Your AI output is fluent but the numbers are off | Your AI is reading stale or fragmented data. The fix is the foundation underneath it, not the model on top. |
| Your AI costs are high relative to the value produced | You are probably running deterministic and rule-based tasks through AI. Audit your workflow with the diagnostic above. |
| You do not know where to start with AI | Start with what you already do well. Map your current workflow. Identify the 10% that requires genuine judgment. Apply AI there first. |
| You are building elaborate AI agents for tasks a deterministic tool handles | Stop. Use the deterministic tool (your platform, a database, or purpose-built software). Redirect that effort to the tasks where AI genuinely helps. |
