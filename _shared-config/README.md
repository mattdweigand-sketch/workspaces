# _shared-config — the organization, captured once

This folder holds the org-level configuration that every workspace shares. It is filled in **once**,
during Run Setup's orientation, and read by every builder and every workspace afterward — so the
organization's name, systems of record, team, and voice are stated in one place instead of
re-collected for each workflow.

## What lives here
- **`org-profile.md`** — the organization: what it does, its systems of record (the platform
  boundary), and its team/roles. Builders read this instead of re-asking org-level questions.
- **`voice-and-tone.md`** — the organization's core written voice (the "direction" file from
  Constraint 05). Every writing workspace references this for the core voice, then adds its own
  register on top (a customer email, a board report, and an internal brief differ in register, not
  in organizational voice).
- **`setup-progress.md`** — created by Run Setup once the organization is onboarded: which
  workspaces have been built, when, and what is next. (Not present until the first setup runs.)

## How workspaces reference it
A workspace built under `workspaces/` reaches this folder by a stable relative path
(`../../_shared-config/...`). Each writing workspace's local voice file is a thin pointer to
`voice-and-tone.md` plus that workspace's register overlay — so updating the org voice once updates
every workspace. If a workspace is ever moved out of this repo, update its pointer to wherever the
organization keeps this shared config.

## How Run Setup uses it
The presence of `setup-progress.md` is how Run Setup distinguishes a first-time setup (orientate,
then build) from a returning one (greet, offer to add a workflow or update config). That file is
written at the end of the first setup, so its absence is the signal that setup has not run yet —
the same flag the root `CLAUDE.md` bootstrap and `SETUP.md` key off.
